    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup chia seeds</li>
        <li>1 cup almond milk or any other milk of your choice</li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoons of honey or maple syrup (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl or jar, mix together chia seeds and almond milk. Stir well to ensure there are no clumps.</li>
        <li>Let the mixture sit for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chia seeds have begun to absorb the liquid and the mixture starts to thicken.</li>
        <li>If you like your pudding sweet, add honey or maple syrup to taste and stir well.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl or jar with plastic wrap or a lid, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight to allow the chia seeds to fully absorb the liquid and form a pudding-like consistency.</li>
        <li>Once the pudding has set, give it a good stir and add any desired toppings, such as fresh fruit, nuts, or granola.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Enjoy your simple and delicious chia pudding!</p>
